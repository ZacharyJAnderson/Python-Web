{# THANKYOU HTML #}

{#

  This Template creates a simple thank you page that displays the users
  first and last name that was entered on the sign up page

  KEY POINTS:

    ** Passing variables with Jinja Templates {{first}} {{last}}

    ** Using a jumbotron from bootstrap 4. This page does not include any links
       for bootstrap, another advantage we leverage from extending base.html.j2

#}

{% extends "base.html.j2" %}
{% block content %}
  <div class="container">
    <div class="jumbotron">
      <h1>{{first}} {{last}}, Thank you for signing up!</h1>
    </div>
  </div>
{% endblock %}
